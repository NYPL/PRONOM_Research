# Getting started with file format research 
This page provides useful information for anyone interested in file format research and contributing to [PRONOM: The Technical Repository](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Default.aspx). You can find more information about our submission process on [the main page of this repository](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research).

## About us
We are a team that maintains PRONOM, a database containing information on file formats which feed information to various file format identification software such as DROID or FIDO.
We come from various backgrounds and have a common interest in file format research which we hope you will share with us. You can read more about us in our [blog post](https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pronom-a-database-centenary/) which celebrated PRONOM's 100th release!

## Starter Pack
We have created this [Starter Pack](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/blob/main/Resources/PRONOM%20Starter%20Guide%20(1).pdf) to make it easier for anyone to research file formats. The guide is divided into easy to follow _Ready, Set, GO!_ structure and includes a _Content page_ so whether you have researched file formats before, or you are just getting started you can easily navigate across the pages to find the most relevant information.

## Submission templates
To make your file format research easier to follow, and to make submitting to PRONOM easier, we have created two templates one in [Microsoft Word document format](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/blob/main/Resources/PRONOM%20Submission%20template.docx) and other in [Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/blob/main/Resources/PRONOM%20Submission%20Temple_spreadsheet.xlsx) so you can choose your preffered working document. These templetes serve as a guidance only and we are always grateful to receive as little, or as a lot, information as possible.
You can also submit information regarding file formats to us using [pull requests on GitHub](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/pulls) which we then collect and merge into our [Submission folder](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/tree/main/Submissions) so you can keep track of how we process your submission.
