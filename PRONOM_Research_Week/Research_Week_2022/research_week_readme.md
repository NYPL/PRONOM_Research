World Digital Preservation Day PRONOM Hackathon (27th October- 3rd November)

PRONOM Research Week is a yearly initiative to help focus community effort on addressing the gaps in PRONOM and building the database. Based on previous research weeks in 2019 and 2020, the PRONOM Team would like to announce the return of PRONOM Research Week for 2022. PRONOM Research Week is a great opportunity to get involved in contributing to PRONOM. 

This year we will have two streams, one for those that want to submit full PRONOM entries or correct signatures and a second for those who would like to update or write descriptions for the file formats in the database. Both are incredibly valuable to the work that PRONOM does.

We have put together resources our GitHub page to get you started in file format research or answer any questions if you get stuck. During the week the PRONOM Team will be available via our regular drop-in sessions to help answer questions. For the week we will be increasing the amount of drop-in sessions we usually hold. The times to join the drop-in sessions can be found here[PRONOM_Research/drop-in.md at main Â· digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research (github.com)]. We will also be talking about Research Week on the 28th at DPConnect with the DPC.
