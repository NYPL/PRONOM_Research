# World Digital Preservation Day PRONOM Hackathon (27th October- 3rd November 2022)

## What is PRONOM Research Week?

PRONOM Research Week is a yearly initiative over the course of a week to help focus community effort on addressing the gaps in PRONOM and making the database better! Based on previous research weeks in 2019 and 2020, the PRONOM Team would like to announce the return of PRONOM Research Week for 2022. PRONOM Research Week is a great opportunity to get involved in contributing to PRONOM. You can read more about what PRONOM is and about our work in our [blog post](https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pronom-a-database-centenary/) which celebrated PRONOM's 100th release!

## How do I get involved?

We want everyone to have the opportunity to get involved (if they would like to)! This year we will have two streams, one for those that want to submit full PRONOM entries or correct signatures and a second for those who would like to update information or write descriptions for the file formats in the database. Both are incredibly valuable to the work that PRONOM does.

## Stream 1

For those who want to correct the signatures within PRONOM, analyse hex or submit full file formats. You may have a file format that hasn't been identifying that you wish to create a siganture for or noticed something that isn't in PRONOM. A full list of file formats in PRONOM can be found [here](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/blob/main/Resources/All_formats_lists/pronom_formats_v108.csv) as of v.108. Stuck for inspiration? An updated list of file formats with no signatures can be found [here](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/blob/main/Resources/formats_without_signatures/formats_without_signatures_october_2022.csv).

## Stream 2

For those of you who may not want to analyse the contents of files we'd still love your help. Many of the file formats in PRONOM do not have full descriptions of the properties of the file format. They only have what we call 'Outline Descriptions'. We have a list [here](https://github.com/digital-preservation/pronom-research-week/blob/master/formats_with_outline_descriptions_only.csv) of these dated from 2020 so double check the format in the database [here](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/PUID/proPUIDSearch.aspx?status=new) to check we haven't updated it. For descriptions we try and keep it concise and objective. More about updating PRONOM descriptions and other information in the database can be found on [the main page of this repository](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research).

## Resources

This page provides useful information for anyone interested in file format research and contributing to [PRONOM: The Technical Repository](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Default.aspx). We have put together resources our GitHub page to get you started in file format research or answer any questions if you get stuck. You can find much more information about our submission process and resources on [the main page of this repository](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research).

### New to file format research?

We have created this [Starter Pack](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/blob/main/Resources/PRONOM%20Starter%20Guide%20(1).pdf) to make it easier for anyone to research file formats. The guide is divided into easy to follow _Ready, Set, GO!_ structure and includes a _Content page_ so whether you have researched file formats before, or you are just getting started you can easily navigate across the pages to find the most relevant information.

### Submission templates
To make your file format research easier to follow, and to make submitting to PRONOM easier, we have created two templates one in [Microsoft Word document format](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/blob/main/Resources/PRONOM%20Submission%20template.docx) and other in [Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/blob/main/Resources/PRONOM%20Submission%20Temple_spreadsheet.xlsx) so you can choose your preffered working document. These templates serve as a guidance only and we are always grateful to receive as little, or as a lot, information as possible.

You can also submit information regarding file formats to us using [pull requests on GitHub](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/pulls) which we then collect and merge into our [Submission folder for Research Week](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/tree/main/PRONOM_Research_Week/Research_Week_2022) so you can keep track of how we process your submission. You can also email us your research, our email is available in the contact information.

## Contact
We always like to hear from anyone interested in file format research! For any quidance or enquiries regarding PRONOM please email us on PRONOM@nationalarchives.gov.uk or use the [Issues page](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/issues). For the week we will be increasing the amount of drop-in sessions we usually hold. The times to join the drop-in sessions can be found [here](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/blob/main/Resources/drop-in.md).
We will also be talking about Research Week on the 28th at DPConnect with the DPC.
