Hi Martin, thanks for this submission. I've added it to our database,so it will go live with our next relase (v.110). I also updated the other entries to lower case.
It's on the latest test signature here: https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/tree/main/Test%20Releases . Best wishes, Kathryn.
