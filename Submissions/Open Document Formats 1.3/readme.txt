This binary/container signature pair will identify only Open Document formats, such as:
Open Document Base
Open Document Graphics
Open Document Presentation
Open Document Spreadsheet
Open Document Text

The new additions are for versions 1.3 of each format. I have also added container signatures for each of the Open Doucmnet Graphics versions as these were previously absent for versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2, which appear to test correctly, although the files I've used for this are not self-generated so I cannot share them.

The files shared here are self-generated using LibreOffice 7.3 and are shared here without restrictions on use. I've separately submitted to PRONOM, and am sharing here for visibility.
